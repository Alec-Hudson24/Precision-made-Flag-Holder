# Precision Manual Mill & Lathe Flag Holder
**stand machined from aluminum using manual mill and lathe operations**  
*(Individual: Manual machining, precision fabrication, Drawing reading)*

## Goal / Overview
- **Primary Features**:
  - Sturdy base and vertical pole holder designed to securely display a flag 
  - Precision-turned cylindrical pole mount press-fit into base
  - Milled and lathed features including counterbores, slots, chamfers, reaming, and flat mounting surfaces for stability and aesthetics
  - Lathed Screws to hold business cards
  - Achieves tight tolerances for smooth assembly and long-term durability
- **Motivation**: Demonstrate hands-on manual machining skills on a real-world, functional product
- **Outcome**: Fully machined, high-precision flag holder ready for use, with excellent surface finish, accurate fits, and professional appearance suitable for indoor/outdoor display.

## Programs and Skills Required
- **Manual Machining**:
  - Manual lathe operations (facing, turning, threading, parting, chamfering)
  - Manual mill operations (face milling, drilling, counterboring, tapping, edge finishing)
- **Other**: Material selection (aluminum for lightweight corrosion resistance), fixturing techniques, precision measurement (calipers, micrometers), deburring, and finishing (sanding/polishing)

## Key Takeaways and Lessons
- Manual machining demands patience, attention to detail, and constant verification—small errors compound quickly, but precise setups and frequent measurements yield professional results.
- Combining lathe and mill operations teaches workflow efficiency: rough lathe turning before milling flats/slots, then finish turning for concentricity.
- Designing for manufacturability (e.g., avoiding undercuts, providing relief for tool access) greatly simplifies the machining process and improves part quality.


## Future Improvements / Ideas
- Add engraved elements 
- Experiment with materials (brass/steel for heavier duty, anodized aluminum for color)
